I currently work as Senior Game Designer at Keen SW House. My other work things prior to that.

I recently published a collection of 20 poems that were written as part of a poetry challenge.

I am always reading a book or two. 

I currently reside in the beautiful city of Prague. I am lucky to have visited 16 different countries in my life so far.

When I'm not working on games I'm playing them.
